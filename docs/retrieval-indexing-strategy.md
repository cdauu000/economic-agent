# Retrieval Indexing Strategy

## Purpose
Optimize semantic retrieval quality.

## Retrieval Strategy

### Primary Search
- semantic vector search

### Secondary Search
- metadata filtering
- keyword matching

## Ranking Factors

1. semantic relevance
2. source reliability
3. recency
4. metadata match

## Retrieval Priority

Highest priority:
- official reports
- verified financial documents
- trusted news sources

## Related
- Vector indexing (ingest): `docs/vector-indexing-strategy.md`

## Implementation Notes
- Use semantic search to gather candidate chunks, then refine with metadata and keyword constraints.
- Apply ranking-factor blending before final context assembly.
- Prefer high-priority trusted sources when evidence conflicts across sources.
